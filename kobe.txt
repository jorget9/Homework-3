Born in 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kobe Bryant 
spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA 
straight out of high school. A dominant scorer, 
Bryant won five NBA championships and the 2008 MVP 
Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although later 
seasons were marred by injuries, he surpassed 
Michael Jordan for third place on the NBA all-time 
scoring list in December 2014, and retired in 2016 
after scoring 60 points in his final game. In 2018 
Bryant earned an Academy Award for Best Animated 
Short Film for Dear Basketball.
